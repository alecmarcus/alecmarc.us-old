    "brief": "An exercise in manipulating physical media to create unique graphic styles and reveal natural systems. How do drastic scale changes affect media that are designed to be static? Balloons were decorated with numerous substances: acrylic paint, spray paint, screen printed plastisol ink, markers, and more, then inflated and deflated. Each application was thoroughly documented with an alpha-numeric ID system. The resulting set of complex textures and otherwordly landscapes were extracted into a graphic language.",

    "brief": "A series of posters for the Open Source Everything manifesto, which calls for a society built upon truth, transparency, and trust. Access to information on the posters is actively obstructed through visual complexity and coded language. Each reflects one of the three main paradigms of computing: the mainframe, the cloud, and edge computing. Accompanying is a US English QWERTY keyboard cover screen printed with binary encoded characters. The piece contextualizes thought, input/output, and screens with the actual information stored on hard drives.",
