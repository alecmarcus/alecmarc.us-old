Access to information on the posters is actively obstructed through visual complexity and coded language. Each reflects one of the three main paradigms of computing: the mainframe, the cloud, and edge computing. Accompanying is a US English QWERTY keyboard cover screen printed with binary encoded characters. The piece contextualizes thought, input/output, and screens with the actual information stored on hard drives.",
